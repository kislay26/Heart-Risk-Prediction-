# Heart-Risk-Prediction-

# Objective
The goal of our heart disease prediction project is to determine if a patient should be diagnosed with heart disease or not, which is a binary outcome, so:

Positive result = 1, the patient will be diagnosed with heart disease

Negative result = 0, the patient will not be diagnosed with heart disease

We have to find which classification model has the greatest accuracy and identify correlations in our data. Finally, we also have to determine which features are the most influential in our heart disease diagnosis.

# Features
We use the following 11 features (X) to determine our predictor (Y):
1. Age
2. Sex: 1 = Male, 0 = Female.
3. chestpaintype: chest pain type (4 values – Ordinal), 1st value: typical angina, 2nd value: atypical angina, 3rd value: non-anginal pain, 4th value: asymptomatic.
4. restingbp: resting blood pressure.
5. cholesterol
6. fastingbs: fasting blood sugar
7. restingecg: resting electrocardiography results.
8. maxhr: maximum heart rate
9. exerciseangina: exercise-induced angina.
10. oldpeak: ST depression caused by exercise relative to rest.
11. st_slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

# Step #1: Data Wrangling
We’ll first look at the dataset we are working with by converting it into a simpler and more understandable format. It would help us use the data more appropriately. 

# Step #2: Conducting EDA

# Step #3: Using Machine Learning Algorithms
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. RandomForest Classifier
4. DecisionTree Classifier
5. XGBoost
6. Gradient Boosting

# Step #4: Finding Feature Score
